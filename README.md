# password-generator
This is a random password generator. It gives the options of using lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. It provides a choice of password length as long as it is from 8-128 characters.
Starter code was provided by the UCSD bootcmap staff. I do not own any of the starter code.
Assistance with the usage of the random number finder on line 33 of script.js was provided by the TA's.
