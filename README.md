# password-generator
This is a random password generator. It gives the options of using lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. It provides a choice of password length as long as it is from 8-128 characters.
Starter code was provided by the UCSD bootcmap staff. I do not own any of the starter code.
Assistance with Javascript was provided by the TA's and through group discussions with my classmates.
When cloning the starter code, I did not move it to a new repository. Instead I worked directly in that directory on accident. This is why I only recently created this repository and moved all the code I had made into this repository.
